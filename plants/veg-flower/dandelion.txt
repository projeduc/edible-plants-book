The dandelion is an abundant "weed" plant that also happens to be edible. In fact, nearly the entire plant can be eaten. The only inedible part is the stem, which can be bitter and contains a milk-like susbstance. Dandelion flowers are a great source of antioxidants as well as vitamins A and B12. The flowers can be in cooking, or steeped in tea. 
The greens, or leaves, can be picked and eaten fresh in a salad. They can also be cooked and added to dishes, similiar to spinach. The greens are abundant in potassium, vitamin A and Vitamin C. They also contain a good amount of sodium, which can be useful in flavoring instead of table salt. 
Lastly, the root. It can be the most labor intensive process to obtain and clean. The roots are commonly dried and used in stews and teas.
